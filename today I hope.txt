UI/DrawingBox:

- smoother lines drawn on drawing surface
- erasing
- less latency on mouse drawing
* save files


Daemus:

- bin/daemus should watch a single folder for changes.
   - rerun will watch the folder for new files.


For normal, non-hexagon rerun building:

- an additional rerun process will run in the projects directory.  It watches for file changes, then posts a new "build file" to the bin/daemus watch directory with the new file.



For Hexagon:
 
- On Save, hexagon writes a new "build file" to the bin/daemus watch folder when a file save occurs. The file will contian the build instructions.



- Remove the whole "and pending destruction" thing, working towards having dialogs submit via an event being sent
