setup_dimentional_projection:
  description: |
    Creates a 3D projection that will mimick the identical 2D projection that you would get from a default ALLEGRO_DISPLAY. For now, it's hard-coded to a width and height of 1920x1080, with top-left coordinates of (0, 0) and bottom right coordinates of (1920, 1080).  Objects in this projection can be rotated and positioned in 3D space, and depth will converge down the center of the screen.
